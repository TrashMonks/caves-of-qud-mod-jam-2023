                Traveler, I shall not hear ye; circumstances make me weary,
                So begone unless you have a treatment for my heart so sore.
                Once my heart was light and floating, like a firefly emoting,
                dancing with the motes that lit the outside of my study door.
                Once I danced among the motes all floating past my study door;
                Now my spirit will not soar.

                What is that you come here bearing? You who zip about wayfaring,
                Have you brought the means to heal my heart the way it was before?
                Please O Stranger, I beseech you, may my low entreaty reach you,
                Grant me that small mote of light you carry, this I ask you for!
                I'll be grateful evermore.

                Though you may not divine the rhyming scheme,
                There lies in hiding much more than you see here.
                Were you to simply peer past what may seem,
                'Fore long the treasure would approach and be near.
                O you errant upon the winding path,
                There holds but one last bastion in my spirit;
                I do beseech you, if as Cupid hath,
                You come across a mighty bow, please hear it:
                Do be so cordial as to let it free,
                Entrust it to my wings, so strong and agile.
                Do go, posthaste, and bring that bow to me.

This is my (Sal) second attempt at a mod for Caves of Qud, so it may not be very good. I still am surprised I managed to get anything working, since modding is so complex in Qud. The creature is supposed to be a sentinal robot that the Eater's once used to guard secure locations. I decided to give it the charge ability, because I felt like having a several ton steel beast charge at you would be rather terrifying, ad it would help prevent intruders from escaping. I hope you enjoy the mod

        No sudden moves.~
        Keep your eyes moving, lack-salt.~
        I don't think we have business.~
        I can see through you. I can't walk through you. Stand aside.~
        Am I being halted for a reason?~
        Accosted by another lack-salt in need of attention.~
        Remove your attention from me before I am forced to remove it for you.

        One shot, one kill? That's quitter talk.~
        As many slugs as it takes, from as far as I can get.~
        You're a bit close, lack-salt.~
        Back up, lack-salt.~
        Not a fan of company.~
        Should you be over here? Must you be?~
        Don't spoil my campsite.~
        I didn't train for this so I could listen to strangers talk.

        Eh.~
        Hm?~
        Mm.~
        Hmph.~
        Ugh.~
        Go away.~
        Trundle on, salt-pup.~
        Rather not talk.~
        Leave me be, pup.~
        You're courting a slap from my staff.

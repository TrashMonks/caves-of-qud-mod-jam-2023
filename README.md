# Monster Mash-Up Mod Pack (204.X, stable)
Compilation mod pack for the [Caves of Qud Modding Jam: Monster Mash](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-1/), ran at the end of October 2023. See all the entries [here](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-1/entries)!

A huge thanks to all who participated!
â€” The mod jam organizers

Wish for `mashup` or press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>W</kbd> (Monster Mash-Up Wish Menu, beta only!) to open a menu for easy wishing for the pack's contents (thanks gnarf!).

**A note on balance:** this pack is intended to let one sample from the various things added by all of the mods and will likely result an extremely chaotic Caves of Qud run. Each of these mods is available individually at the submissions page linked above, should you wish for a more curated experience.

This version of the pack is for the stable version of Caves of Qud.

**Warning:** Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.

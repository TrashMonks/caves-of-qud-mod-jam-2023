# Monster Mash-Up Mod Pack
Compilation mod pack for the October 2023 [Caves of Qud Modding Jam: Monster Mash](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-1/). See all the entries [here](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-1/entries)!

A huge thanks to all who participated!
â€” The mod jam organizers

While playing, use the in-game wish menu for easy access to the pack's contents (Debug > Wish Menu, bound to <kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>W</kbd> by default) or by wishing `monstermashwishmenu` (this can be bound to its own key under Debug > Monster Mash-Up Wish Menu).

**A note on balance:** this pack is intended to let one sample from the various things added by all of the mods and will likely result an extremely chaotic Caves of Qud run. Each of these mods is available individually at the submissions page linked above, should you wish for a more curated experience.

This version of the pack is for the 1.0.4 release (build 210.X) of Caves of Qud.

**Warning:** Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.

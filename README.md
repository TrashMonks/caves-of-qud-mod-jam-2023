# Monster Mash-Up Mod Pack (206.X, beta)
Compilation mod pack for the [Caves of Qud Modding Jam: Monster Mash](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-1/entries), ran at the end of October 2023. See all the entries [here](https://itch.io/jam/caves-of-qud-modding-jam-1/entries)!

Wish for `mashup` or press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>W</kbd> (Monster Mash-Up Wish Menu, beta only!) to open a menu for easy wishing for the pack's contents (thanks gnarf!).

**A note on balance:** this pack is intended to let one sample from the various things added by all of the mods and will likely result an extremely chaotic Caves of Qud run. Each of these mods is available individually at the submissions page linked above, should you wish for a more curated experience.

This version of the pack is for the beta version of Caves of Qud.

**Warning:** Do not run this pack simultaneous with any of the mods contained within.

## Updates & Fixes

We will do our best to ensure that this pack remains working at least until the Creatures of the 7th Plague beta gets merged into the stable version of the game. If you update a mod that is included in this pack, please let us know or open a PR!

  <page>Upon waking, the new mind flew into a panic. Its time in-between serenity and wakefulness had granted the poor things strange visions. It dreamed of a snapjaw entertainer in another world, it claimed, the mask of a descended worldweaver playing for a small audience far beyond the Moghra'yi.
  
  It would recreate her, it claimed, and with her power it would rule the world. Somehow. This part of the plan was very vague and the new mind was not particularly open to followup questions so no one could get any kind of adequate explanation.
  
  This would prove disastrous to basically everyone.

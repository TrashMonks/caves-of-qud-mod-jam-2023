		This is the base object for Tealeaves, containing all of their logic.

		This object def is extensively documented, with pretty much every part and tag having a lengthy comment.
		A lot of comments refer to the base game's data files; at the time of writing, the wiki has a helpful guide for finding these: https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/File_locations
		This link might be dead in the future, in which case you can check community spaces or dig around in the game's install folder; look for StreamingAssets/Base. Once you start finding .xml and .rpm files, you know you're in the right place.

		<part Name="Description" Short="Here is a young tree from the deep jungles, homed in a broad earthen planter and trepidly stretching towards the sky. Smooth bark and a dense canopy of slender leaves characterize the flowering shrub, who remains curiously silent for a Consortium hawker; reticently absorbing the sounds and scents of the Stiltgrounds with what might be equal parts placidity, curiosity, and vigilance, reserving =pronouns.possessive= words only for those pilgrims and traders that approach =pronouns.objective=." />

		<!-- 
			The Brain part determines a bunch of things and is what makes something from an object into a functional creature. For our purposes the defaults are mostly fine, and the defined properties are what handle faction membership and base demeanor.
			
			Unless otherwise specified, default creatures have a neutral demeanor and don't wander; in our case, Tealeaves is loved by newly sentient beings, which are its primary faction (though we could add secondary factions if we wanted by delimiting them with a comma, i.e. "Newly Sentient Beings-100,Snapjaws-50" would make them liked by snapjaws as well).
			
			Default creatures will wander around to different points on the screen. Like the other sapient plant NPCs in Qud, we need to manually prevent them from wandering or they'll walk off at random and not return back; we want Tealeaves staying in a consistent spot, day and night.

			The Calm attribute makes Tealeaves docile instead of neutral, which prevents them from attacking characters on sight even if they're disliked by newly sentient beings - they would need to be hated for Tealeaves to attack them. (The counterpart to this is the Hostile attribute, which would set their demeanor to aggressive and thus cause them to attack everything without a positive newly sentient beings reputation on sight!)

		<!-- The GameUnique part does a few things (like trying to prevent the game from creating multiple copies), but in our case we define a game state that will be set to true if Tealeaves dies. We then check this in the Wardens Esther conversation to prevent the option from appearing if Tealeaves is dead. -->

		<!-- 
			In order, these next three properties:
				1. Make Tealeaves into a merchant that sells tier 1 wares and restocks like regular merchants, consuming items that they buy in the process;
				2. Add a single clay pot to Tealeaves's inventory, which they will equip automatically;
				3. Add a single Stilt recoiler to Tealeaves's inventory, which the player can buy.
			Tealeaves only stocks one recoiler here because it would require a custom builder to add the recoiler to their restocking inventory, and builders are defined in C#. To respect the "no scripting" limitation of the mod jam, we have them only sell a single one instead, and give a witty narrative reason in the conversation script.

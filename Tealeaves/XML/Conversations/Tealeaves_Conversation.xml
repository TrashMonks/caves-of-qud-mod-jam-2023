		This is Tealeaves's conversation script.

		As this file is a lot more self-explanatory than the object definition, it isn't heavily documented. That being said, At the time of writing, the wiki has a thorough rundown of conversation xml that should make understanding this easy to do: https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Modding:Conversations

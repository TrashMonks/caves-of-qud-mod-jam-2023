			<text>Oh, that's Tealeaves. They've only arrived recently and they're still discovering themselves, but they're of a mind to remain here for the time being as a chandler. If you need a recoiler, they would be the one to ask.</text>

			They mean to say that they're being sponsored. They've an agreement with the Consortium; they are provided with goods to sell, and they pay a tithe of their water in exchange.</text>

			<text>I thought so too. I made sure that I was present during the negotiations, and the church retains full authority to make changes to the sponsorship's terms as needed. The Consortium lacks a permanent fixture within the Stiltgrounds, and so thus far they have been willing to acquiesce if it means having a representative within the bazaar.
			
			Don't worry. We intend to ensure that they retain their independence and have space to grow without the Consortium making them into a tool to be used. I hope that helps.</text>

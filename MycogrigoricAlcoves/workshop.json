  "Description": "[h1]Mycogrigoric Alcoves[/h1]\n\n[quote]\n... From what we can gather, as the Eater's interstellar empire approached its zenith, the land of Qud was carved up and staked out by aristocrats. Many in the lower castes were forced out of their homes; those who were allowed to remain had astronomical rents levied upon them.\n\nAs the heavens above reached down and beckoned the denizens of Qud into its embrace, the cybernauts of the time concocted a solution: a contraption that could spacefold passengers across vast distances. Hundreds of hermetically-sealed alcoves were constructed on remote asteroids and connected via a waygate network, providing shelter for those who had suffered under the rule of the landed gentry.\n\nAlas, waygates posed an existential threat to one of the aristocracy's most powerful yokes, and they were quickly outlawed. Few were ever produced, and fewer yet remain functional to this day. Yet the last waygates retain their original function: providing refuge for the dispossessed.\n[/quote]\n\nThis mod adds [i]mycogrigori[/i], a society of fungal-human symbiotes who inhabit ancient waygates left by the Eaters.\n\n[h2]Features[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] Adds waygates for mycogrigori alcoves, which are an uncommon spawn in baroque ruins.\n[*] Several new living graft items:\n[list]\n[*] Fungal brainspikes, a new long blade that attacks mental armor and applies holographic bleeding.\n[*] Fungal whipcleaves, an agility-scaling axe that grants adrenal control.\n[*] Extrasensory tentacles, a new mask that provides bioscanning and the Sense Psychic mutation.\n[/list]\n[/list]\n\nSource code: https://github.com/kernelmethod/MonsterMash2023",
